## Description

Here we have all the code required to run the backend of a social media application!  I wanted to develop a simple RESTful api to manage a users friends list, thoughts and reactions. I ran into some difficulties figuring out how to add reactions to individual thoughts but was able to reference some previous classwork and figure it out! Throughout this process i learned a lot about NoSql databases, specifically MongoDB.
